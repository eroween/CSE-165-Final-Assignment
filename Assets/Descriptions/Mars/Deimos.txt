Deimos is the smaller and outer of the two natural satellites of the planet Mars, the other being Phobos. Deimos has a mean radius of 6.2 km (3.9 mi) and takes 30.3 hours to orbit Mars. In Greek mythology, Deimos was the twin brother of Phobos and personified terror.

Deimos is 23,460 km (14,580 mi) from Mars, much further than Mars's other moon, Phobos.
